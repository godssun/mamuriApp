## Project Name

mamuriApp

## One-line Description

An AI-powered diary app where users write daily journals and receive

immediate, empathetic responses from an AI friend.

---

## Target Users

- People who want emotional support through journaling

- Users who value privacy and emotional safety

- Individuals seeking gentle, non-judgmental reflection

---

## Core Value Proposition

- Writing as emotional release

- AI as a consistent, caring presence

- Immediate feedback that feels human and warm

---

## MVP Scope (Must-have)

1. User authentication (email + password)

2. Diary creation, editing, deletion

3. Immediate AI-generated empathetic comment per diary

4. Diary list and detail views

5. Basic user settings (AI tone preferences)

---

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Social features

- Public sharing

- Advanced analytics

- Subscription/payments

---

## AI Comment Rules (MVP)

- One AI comment per diary

- Generated immediately after save

- Failure-safe: diary saves even if AI fails

- Retry option available

---

## Privacy & Transparency

- Users are explicitly informed that AI generates comments

- Diary content may be sent to an external AI provider

- AI-generated data is not used for model training

- Users can disable AI comments if desired

---

## Success Metrics (Early)

- Daily active users (DAU)

- Diary completion rate

- Retention after first week

- User feedback on AI empathy quality
